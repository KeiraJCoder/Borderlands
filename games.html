    <h1>Borderlands</h1>
    <h2>(The Original One)</h2>

    <p class="one">The planet of Pandora holds a legendary secret: A Vault supposedly filled with treasures and riches untold. The Dahl Corporation was attempting to search for the Vault, only to suddenly give up and leave its employees stranded on the planet. These employees slowly lost their minds, becoming the franchise’s iconic psychos. Aside from the bandits, the Atlas Corporation and their mercenary group the Crimson Lance are attempting to collect the alien keys and open the Vault for themselves. <br><br>

        You play as the Vault Hunters, one of four elite killers with different abilities who, as their name implies, are searching for the Vault. They are in communication with the Guardian Angel, a mysterious woman helping the group collect the keys and open the Vault. The Vault Hunters battle the Crimson Lance who eventually open the vault, only to be killed by the giant monster imprisoned within. As it turns out, the Vault is a prison built by an ancient alien race to hold the monster, called The Destroyer. Whoops. The Vault Hunters are able to kill The Destroyer, and the vault is resealed. In the game’s final moments, it is revealed that the Guardian Angel is communicating through a satellite in the planet’s orbit … owned by the Hyperion Corporation.</p>

        At the hard edge of the galaxy lies a group of planets ruthlessly exploited by militarized corporations. Brimming with loot and violence, this is your home—the Borderlands. Now, a crazed cult known as The Children of the Vault has emerged and is spreading like an interstellar plague.
